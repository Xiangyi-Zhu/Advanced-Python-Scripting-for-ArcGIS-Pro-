#3.6 Setting tool parameters
#Parameter Data Type: 
#(1)Feature Layer (on the tool dialog box, a user can use a drop-down list to select from the feature 
#layers in the current map but also can browse to a feature class on disk)
#(2)Feature Class (sounds similar to Feature Layer, but you can only use the feature classes on 
#disk and does not allow for the use of feature layers in the current map)
#(Optional) Multiple values option means you can enter multiple values of the same data type as a single
#parameter. These values are passed to a script as a list of values.
#(Optional) Table of vlaues (enter multiple values in a table format, tools like Intersect and Union use this 
#table of values format, also referred to as a value table.
#Parameters with multiple values are passed to the script as a string, with the individual element
#is seperated by ';', split method split the string into list:
#syntax:
#import arcpy
#input = arcpy.GetParamterAsText(0)
#input_list = input.split(';')
#Parameters with multiple values can also be handled using arcpy.GetParameter(), in this case, 
#result is a list of values, and individual values can be obtained using an index or by 
#iterating over the list.
#Parameters consist of a table of values, can use GetParameter() to obtain a ValueTable object,
#the values are stored in a virtual table of rows and columns. ValueTable is an ArcPy class that 
#is specifically designed for table of values.

#Three choices for Type: Required, Optional, and Derived

#1.2 Python scripting in ArcGIS Pro using ArcPy
#Python scripting can be used to extend the functionality of ArcGIS Pro and automate workflows.
#Python is also directly embedded in many tools in ArcGIS Pro. 
#e.g. (1) Python is one of the standard expression types in field calculations
#     (2) some geoprocessing tools consists of Python scripts, e.g. Split by Attribute in Analysis tool - extract

#Two main goals in this book
#(1)
#develop new geoprocessing tools that expand the functionality of ArcGIS Pro which look like the regular tools
#that are part of the software (This is accomplished using Python scripts tools and Python toolboxes
#(2)
#become familiar with the ArcGIS API for Python to expand the use of Python to working with web GIS
#(accomplished using notebooks)

#1.3 Python version and ArcGIS
#Some changes in Python 3 are fundamental, which result in breaking with the backward campatibility 
#philosophy of Python
#Officially Python 2 will no longer be maintained past 2020, which means any existing code will continue to 
#work, but there will be no further improvement to version 2.

#1.4 ArcGIS API for Python and Jupyter Notebook
#ArcGIS Pro (Python & ArcPy) is a desktop application, which is mainly designed to munipulate local data.
#ArcPy has limited functionality to work with web GIS.
#ArcGIS API (typically written by Jupiter Notebook) for Python is a different Python package from ESRI to work directly with web GIS, 
#which complements the use of ArcPy for desktop GIS.

#1.6 A note about code in this book
#ArcGIS Pro 2.5 use ArcGIS API for Python version 1.7.0.
#ArcGIS API for python can be installed seperately. If installed separately, Python 3.5 is required to use the ArcGIS API for Python.

#1.7 Working with Python editor
#Python editor, such as IDLE, Spyder, and PyCharm

#1.8 Exploring examples scripts, tools, and notebooks
#this section uses several examples to illustrate how Python is used to create scripts, tools, and notebooks
#1.8.1 Example 1: Terrain Tools
#In this example: a collection of tools, which represent terrain, are in a toolbox. These tools look like the regular geoprocessing tools
#and were writen in Python.
#Each tool of this toolbox carried out a series of steps, which can be accomplished by running regular geoprocessing tools and applying 
#symbology. The purpose of these script tool is to automate separate geoprocessing steps and provides a user-friendly interface.

#1.8.2 Example 2: Random Sample
#This tol provides functionality not available in ArcGIS pro. 
#some online resourses at http://stackexchange.com and ESRI Support http://support.esri.com

#1.8.3 3D Fences toolbox
#For more info, search 3D Fences toolbox at www.arcgis.com

#1.8.4 Notebook for wildfire analysis
#This example uses ArcGIS API for Python to work with web GIS.

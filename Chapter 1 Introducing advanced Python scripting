#1.2 Python scripting in ArcGIS Pro using ArcPy
#Python scripting can be used to extend the functionality of ArcGIS Pro and automate workflows.
#Python is also directly embedded in many tools in ArcGIS Pro. 
#e.g. (1) Python is one of the standard expression types in field calculations
#     (2) some geoprocessing tools consists of Python scripts, e.g. Split by Attribute in Analysis tool - extract

#Two main goals in this book
#(1)
#develop new geoprocessing tools that expand the functionality of ArcGIS Pro which look like the regular tools
#that are part of the software (This is accomplished using Python scripts tools and Python toolboxes
#(2)
#become familiar with the ArcGIS API for Python to expand the use of Python to working with web GIS
#(accomplished using notebooks)

#1.3 Python version and ArcGIS
#Some changes in Python 3 are fundamental, which result in breaking with the backward campatibility 
#philosophy of Python
#Officially Python 2 will no longer be maintained past 2020, which means any existing code will continue to 
#work, but there will be no further improvement to version 2.

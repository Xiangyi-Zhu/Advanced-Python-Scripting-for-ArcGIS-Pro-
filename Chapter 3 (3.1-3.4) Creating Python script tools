#3.1 Intro
#This chapter show how to turn a Python script into a script tool
#Script tools makes it easier to share scripts with others.

#3.2 Script tools VS Python toolbox
#3.2.1 Create a tool using script tool
#The language for this tool is mostly python, but other scripting languages that accept argument can also 
#be used.
#Tool properties and parameters are created manually using interface options of the ArcGIS Pro application.

#3.2.2 Create a tool using a Python toolbox
#The entire tool dialog box is written in Python, and saved as a .pyt file
#which is recognized as a Python toolbox in ArcGIS Pro.
#A single Python toolbox can contain multiple tools, all written in the same script file 

#3.3 Why create your own tools?
#Any model created and saved using ModelBuilder is a tool because it is in a toolbox (.tbx file) 
#or a geodatabase
#Python scripts can be run in two ways: 
#(1) a stand-alone script runs from operating system or from within a Python editor.
#(2) As a tool within ArcGIS Pro
